Email communication, while indispensable in modern business and personal correspondence, faces a significant challenge from spam emails. This study investigates the efficacy of various machine learning(Random Forest and SVM) and deep learning (GRU and LSTM) algorithms for email spam detection. The findings underscore the need for lightweight algorithms that balance accuracy with energy conservation, contributing to more sustainable practices in machine learning applications. The RF model achieved an impressive accuracy and F1 score of 98%, outperforming the baseline model, while the SVM model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy and F1 score of 99%. Despite SVM's higher accuracy, RF was chosen for its robust performance in handling high-dimensional data and its lower computational resource requirements compared to SVM, making it a suitable choice for spam classification tasks.
